## Dataset Description
The dataset is taken from Kaggle (UCI Heart Disease). It contains 1025 patient records with 13 input features and 1 target variable indicating presence of heart disease.

## Models Used and Performance

| Model | Accuracy | AUC | Precision | Recall | F1 | MCC |
|-------|---------|-----|-----------|-------|-----|-----|
| Logistic Regression |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Decision Tree |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| KNN |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Naive Bayes |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Random Forest |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| XGBoost |   |   |   |   |   |   |

## Model Observations

| Model | Observation |
|-------|-------------|
| Logistic Regression | Simple linear model with stable performance |
| Decision Tree | Overfits on training data |
| KNN | Sensitive to scaling |
| Naive Bayes | Performs fast but less accurate |
| Random Forest | High accuracy and stable |
| XGBoost | Best overall performance |
