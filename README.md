# Machine Learning Assignment 2 

## Problem Statement
The goal of this assignment is to implement multiple classification models on a chosen dataset, evaluate their performance using standard metrics, and deploy an interactive Streamlit web application. The app should allow dataset upload, model selection, and display of evaluation results.

## Dataset Description
- **Dataset Source:** [Add Kaggle/UCI link here]
- **Type:** [Binary / Multi-class classification]
- **Number of Features:** [At least 12]
- **Number of Instances:** [At least 500]
- **Target Variable:** [Specify target column]

## Models Implemented
The following six classification models were implemented on the same dataset:
1. Logistic Regression  
2. Decision Tree Classifier  
3. K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) Classifier  
4. Naive Bayes Classifier (Gaussian or Multinomial)  
5. Random Forest (Ensemble)  
6. XGBoost (Ensemble)  

## Evaluation Metrics
The models were evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy  
- AUC Score  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1 Score  
- Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)  

### Comparison Table

| ML Model Name         | Accuracy | AUC | Precision | Recall | F1 | MCC |
|------------------------|----------|-----|-----------|--------|----|-----|
| Logistic Regression    |          |     |           |        |    |     |
| Decision Tree          |          |     |           |        |    |     |
| kNN                    |          |     |           |        |    |     |
| Naive Bayes            |          |     |           |        |    |     |
| Random Forest          |          |     |           |        |    |     |
| XGBoost                |          |     |           |        |    |     |

*(Fill in values after running models.)*

## Observations on Model Performance

| ML Model Name          | Observation about model performance |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression     |                                     |
| Decision Tree           |                                     |
| kNN                     |                                     |
| Naive Bayes             |                                     |
| Random Forest           |                                     |
| XGBoost                 |                                     |

*(Add insights such as which model performed best, trade-offs between metrics, etc.)*
