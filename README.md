# ML Assignment 2 - Multiple Classifiers + Streamlit App

## a) Problem Statement

Build and compare multiple machine-learning classification models on **one public dataset**, compute evaluation metrics, and demonstrate the models in an interactive **Streamlit** web application.  
The app supports uploading test CSV data, selecting a model, viewing evaluation metrics, and viewing a confusion matrix / classification report.


## b) Dataset Description

**Dataset:** *Adult Income Dataset* (UCI Machine Learning Repository)  
- **Task:** Binary classification (income `<=50K` vs `>50K`)  
- **Size:** ~32,000 instances and 14 features (meets assignment minimums)  
- **Feature origin:** Census data describing demographic and employment attributes.  
- **Target encoding used in this repo:** `target = 1` for **income >50K**, `target = 0` for **income <=50K**

## c) Models Used + Evaluation Metrics

Models implemented (all on the same dataset):
1. Logistic Regression  
2. Decision Tree Classifier  
3. K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)  
4. Naive Bayes (Gaussian)  
5. Random Forest (Ensemble)  
6. XGBoost (Ensemble)  

**Metrics computed (as required):** Accuracy, AUC, Precision, Recall, F1 score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC).

### 📝 Observations on Model Performance

| ML Model Name         | Observation about model performance |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression   | Performs well overall with balanced precision-recall; interpretable baseline. |
| Decision Tree         | Captures non-linear patterns but prone to overfitting; weaker than ensembles. |
| kNN                   | Sensitive to scaling; works well when classes are well-separated. |
| Naive Bayes           | Fast baseline; independence assumption limits performance when features correlate. |
| Random Forest         | Strong ensemble; high accuracy and balanced metrics; robust to overfitting. |
| XGBoost               | Often achieves top performance; sequential boosting corrects errors effectively. |
